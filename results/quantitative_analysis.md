# POPULATION VECTOR DIFFERENCE DURING RULE SWITCH: HPC

Can we characterize the transition of the population states during rule switch?

**Analysis methods**:
* within rule cos-distance vs. accross rules cos-distance
* filtered data where speed < 5 cm/s and all zero population vectors

## Results using spatial bins (10cm)

* RULE 1: light, RULE 2: west

* can we tell something from different results of the normalization by rule 1 and rule b?
